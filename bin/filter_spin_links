    Filter 3D Xeasy spin links based on a file for use with CYANA

    This script allows you to easily mark a list of spin links as "bad
    fits". These spin links can still be retained for CYANA calculations,
    but they are set to the maximum allowed distance.

    For each spin link in the move file, copy the corresponding peak in the
    source Xeasy file and paste it in the target Xeasy file. Change the
    integration volume of each peak in the target file to 1.0. Retain the
    peak in the source XEASY file, but comment it.

    When using the target Xeasy file with CYANA calibration, the
    corresponding UPL will be set to the maximum allowed distance.
    
    A CARA spin ID file is required, because XEASY files do not store
    assignment information. Use the CARA Lua script provided in the
    nmrpeaklists library to create it.

    Move file format
    ----------------
    Each line in the file is a peak. Each peak is a list of spin names. Each
    spin name should contain three parts: a one-letter code for the amino
    acid type; an integer residue number; and finally a dash followed by an
    atom name. When two atoms form a spin anchor, their names should be
    combined into one. A spin anchor is a directly attached hydrogen/heavy
    atom pair. For a spin anchor, list the residue type and residue number
    once and combine the atom names with a slash. You can add or remove
    peaks to be filtered with the '#' symbol.
